# markdowns

## Goal

collect writeups, notes, stuff

## Why

because everything is so fragmented

## md1

section seperated by empty lines

two spaces generate line break  
before the next line

headings #, ##, ### and so on, or underline ====

italics by `*` for example *this* is slanted

boldface by `**` for example **this** is bold

both using `***` i.e. ***very emph***

sepline `- - -` or `---` or `___`
- - -
three 
___
stars
* * *

it is possible `[^to use footnotes]` by [^using this]

## md lists

+ using `+-*` and a blank
+ nextplus
  - deep
  - down
  - nested using two blanks
+ anotherplus

* firststar
* secondstar
* thirdstar

1. alpha numbers, just use them
2. beta
3. gamma

>quotes are done just like
>they would be in email `>` and `>>`
>>and can be nested

## How Math Works

Like $a+b=3$ in Tex, also with
$$
\int f(x) dx = 2\pi i
$$
multiline support (doesn't work in GitHub, meh)!
But maybe...
