## Goal

collect writeups, notes, stuff

## Why

because everything is so fragmented

two spaces generate line break  
before the next line

headings #, ##, ### and so on, or underline ====

italics by `*` for example *this* is slanted

boldface by `**` for example **this** is bold

both using `***` i.e. ***very emph***

## md lists
